A visualization tool that reveals how neural network training paths influence final classification outcomes. Train the network and observe which pathways are critical for decision-making while most paths remain inactive.

## Key Insights
- Visualize active vs. inactive neural pathways during training
- Understand which connections drive classification decisions
- Observe path sparsity in trained networks
- See how few critical paths determine final outcomes
